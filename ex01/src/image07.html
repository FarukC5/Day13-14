                <p> Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, usually for recreation, sport, exercise,
                    or survival. Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both.
                    Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks
                    of birth, as a survival response.
