                    or sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bicyclists", or "bikers". Apart
                    from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles,
                    recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
